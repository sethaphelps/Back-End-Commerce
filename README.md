# Work Day Scheduler

This assignment required me to refactor existing code to ultimately create the back end for an e-commerce site. I have created an Express.js API that uses sequilize to interact with a MYSQL database. 

After the user has added their database, they can connect to it using Sequlize. 

Next, they need to ender schema and seed commands which will populate it with test data. 

Once the comand to is entered to invoke the application, the server starts and the Sequilize models are synced to the MySQL database. 

The user then can run the API GET routes in Insomnia to display the seeded data.

The user can also run POST, PUT, and DELETE routes create, update, and delete data from the database.
